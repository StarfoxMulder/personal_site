					<h3>Work Style</h3>
					<p>Aside from chronic dependence on multiple monitors, I'm about as adaptable, innovative, and eager to push
						boundaries as a developer can be.<br><br>
						Collaborating with other people who appreciate intellectual humility, knowledge sharing, and value creation can
						make work feel like home.<br><br>
						With me, you not only get a full-stack developer, but as a special bonus I come fully equpied with a background
						in organizational operations, process improvement, project management, and market oriented approaches to design
						thinking. Wow!

					<h3>Favorite Mental Models</h3>
					<p>
						Principled Entrepreneurship<br>
						Creative Destruction<br>
						Systems Thinking<br>
						Opportunity Cost | Sunk Costs | Trade-offs<br>
						Parkinson's Law<br>
						Strong Opinions Loosely Held<br>

					<h3>General World View</h3>
					<p>
						Understanding is reached after confrontation; fear is antithetical to progress.<br><br>
						Maintaining a kind, open, inviting, and honest attitude will save you worlds of grief while generating universes
						of opportunity.<br><br>
						What's more incredible than being alive? Retaining a perspective rooted in levity, humor, enjoyment, and
						inventiveness can overcome the problems it can't resolve.<br><br>
						Creating value for people and creatures is, like, the best feeling ever - so, you know, just do that as much as
						you can.

					<h3>Background</h3>
					<p>
						Over the course of doing process improvement work for several years, it became emergently clear how powerful the
						right technology could be in reducing end-to-end costs and freeing people to focus on higher value opportunities.
						My curiosity and interest in gaining new skills led me to self-study front-end languages in my own time.
						<br><br>
						From there I applied and was aceepted into The Coding Bootcamp at UNC Chapel Hill where I had a phenomenally
						intense, immersive experience building full-stack applications.
						<br><br>
						Since graduating I've held programming positions with Lenovo and Verizon. In my spare time I love working on side
						projects to expand my skills and grow as a developer.
