            <p>About four years ago I was introduced to Excel Macros by a friend. From there my loves for solving
              problems, innovating, making things work, and building functional applications found perfect harmony in
              software programming. I started creating automated workbooks and holding training sessions on Excel for
              my co-workers.</p>
              <p>Soon I was teaching myself front-end languages in my spare time then went on to The Coding
              Bootcamp at UNC Chapel Hill. Since graduating I've worked in development positions at Lenovo and Verizon,
              all along the way continuing to expand my skills.</p>
            <p>I primarily work in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but I'm not afraid to challenge myself with new languages
              and frameworks. Below you'll see projects utilizing React, NodeJS, Python, Django, Vue and others.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>I am blessed to have my wife, our dog, our cats, our broader family and our friends - but clearly not
              with great PhotoShop skills.</p>
            <p>Brianna and I are working toward having children, but in the meantime StarFox (5 yearold Lab/Pyrenees
              mix), Small (the little butthead in my arms), and Ari (the perfect angel on Brianna's lap) are the little
              weirdos we're lovingly doting on.</p>
